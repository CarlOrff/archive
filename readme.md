## Requirements

Perl 5.24 (earlier versions not tested but it is likely to work with every build that is capabale of getting the required modules installed). If there are issues with installing the `XMLRPC::lite` module, do it with CPAN's `notest` pragma.

## Usage

Collect URLs you want to archive in file `urls.txt` separated by one or more line breaks and UTF-8-encoded and call `perl archive.pl`. The script does to things: it fetches the URLs and extracts some metadata (works with HTML and PDF). It submits them to Internet Archive. Then it generates a HTML file with a link list that you may post to your blog or use autmoated submission to WordPress. Alternatively you can get the link list as Atom feed. If login credentials are provided but no FTP host, it is posted to WordPress. The WP URL must point to the `xmlrpc.php`. Additionally you can post the links on Twitter. Regardless of the format you can upload the file on a server via FTP.

Internet Archive has a submission limit of 15 URLs per minute per IP. Set an appropriate delay (at least five seconds) to meet it. If you want to be faster, set a proxy server which rotates IPs. This is fi. possible with TOR as service (the TOR browser on Windows does not work here!). Set `MaxCircuitDirtiness 10` in the configuration file (`/path/to/torrc`) to rotate IPs every ten seconds.

There are several optional switches

`-a` output as Atom feed instead of HTML

`-c <creator>` name of feed creator (feed only)

`-d <path>` FTP path

`- D` Debug mode - don't save to Internet Archive

`-f <filename>` name of input file if other than `urls.txt`

`-h` Show commands

`-i <title>` Feed or HTML title

`-k <consumer key>` Twitter consumer key

`-l` save linked documents

`-n <username>` FTP or WordPress user

`-o <host>` FTP host

`-p <password>` FTP or WordPress password

`-P <proxy>` A proxy, fi. socks4://localhost:9050 for TOR service

`-r` obey `robots.txt`

`-s` save feed in Wayback machine

`-t <access token>` Twitter access token

`-T <seconds>` delay per URL in seconds to respect IA's request limit

`-u <URL>` Feed or WordPress (`xmlrpc.php`) URL

`-w` *deprecated*

`-x <secret consumer key>` Twitter secret consumer key

`-y <secret access token>` Twitter secret access token

`-z <time zone>` Time zone (WordPress only)
